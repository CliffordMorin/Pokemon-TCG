To learn how to install Node, [Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

Next you will need to install the packages. To do so type in the following commands into your terminal.

```bash
npm install
```
Running this command will download the necessary dependancies for the application to run.

If running locally, make sure to use the 'db' folder to set up the database, as well as running the command

This will seed your database with a starter environment to work from.

# Concept

For this application, we wanted to display different images from an api. Depending on the route, log in status, session, etc, we wanted to dynamically show information to the user.

We settled on Pokemon, since we all grew up watching and loving the franchise. The user flow  was based mostly on the galleries activity we worked on in our class.

The Pokemon data was referenced from the [Pok√©mon TCG Developers API](https://pokemontcg.io)
